# Factory Method Design Pattern

This directory contains a sample implementation of the Factory Method design pattern in Java.

## Overview

The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes loose coupling by ensuring that the client code interacts with the interface rather than the concrete implementation.

## Implementation

- **Product**: Interface for the products created by the factory.
- **Concrete Products (ConcreteProductA, ConcreteProductB)**: Implementations of the Product interface.
- **Creator (Factory)**: Interface for the factory method which creates products.
- **Concrete Creators (ConcreteCreatorA, ConcreteCreatorB)**: Implementations of the Creator interface that override the factory method to create specific products.
- **Client code**: Demonstrates how to use the factory to create products.

## Real-life Use Cases

- **GUI Frameworks**: GUI frameworks often use the Factory Method pattern to create different types of UI elements such as buttons, text fields, and checkboxes.
- **Logging Libraries**: Logging libraries use the Factory Method pattern to create different types of loggers (e.g., file logger, console logger, database logger) based on the configuration.
- **Database Drivers**: Database drivers use the Factory Method pattern to create database connections based on the type of database being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
