# Singleton Design Pattern

This directory contains a sample implementation of the Singleton design pattern in Java.

## Overview

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used when a single instance of a class is required to control access to a shared resource or when an object needs to be shared across the entire application.

## Implementation

- **Singleton**: This class implements the singleton pattern. It has a private static variable `instance` to hold the single instance of the class. The constructor is private to prevent instantiation from outside, and a public static method `getInstance()` is provided to get the single instance.
- **SingletonMain**: Demonstrates how to use the singleton pattern by getting the singleton instance and calling a method on it.

## Real-life Use Cases

- **Logger**: Logging frameworks often use the singleton pattern to provide a single point of access to the logger instance across the application.
- **Configuration Managers**: Configuration managers or managers for application settings can be implemented as singletons to ensure that configuration settings are consistent throughout the application.
- **Database Connection Pool**: Database connection pools can be implemented using the singleton pattern to manage a single pool of database connections that can be shared across the application.
