# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

This directory contains a sample implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern in Java.

## Overview

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows clients to create objects without needing to know their concrete classes, promoting loose coupling and adhering to the open/closed principle.

## Implementation

- **Abstract Product**: Interface for each distinct type of product family (e.g., AbstractProductA, AbstractProductB).
- **Concrete Products (ConcreteProductA1, ConcreteProductA2, ConcreteProductB1, ConcreteProductB2)**: Implementations of the Abstract Product interfaces.
- **Abstract Factory**: Interface that declares a set of methods for creating each distinct type of product.
- **Concrete Factories (ConcreteFactory1, ConcreteFactory2)**: Implementations of the Abstract Factory interface, responsible for creating products of a specific family.
- **Client code**: Demonstrates how to use the abstract factory to create products of different families.

## Real-life Use Cases

- **GUI Toolkits**: Abstract Factory pattern is extensively used in GUI toolkits where different components like buttons, text fields, and dropdowns need to be created based on the underlying operating system or look-and-feel.
- **Database Access Libraries**: In database access libraries, the abstract factory pattern can be used to provide database-specific implementations for various operations like connecting to a database, executing queries, etc., without exposing the concrete database classes to the client.
- **Cross-platform UI Frameworks**: Frameworks like Java's AWT and Swing use abstract factories to create platform-specific UI components without exposing platform-specific details to the client code.
